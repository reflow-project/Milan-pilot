# Foody Zero Waste
## BOTTO IoT device

**BOTTO** is an automated communication solution integrated with a tracking and redistribution system based on the blockchain network [ReflowOS](https://github.com/dyne/reflow-os) that facilitates the reallocation of surplus food.

**BOTTO** is made of two main components:  
- A physical **IoT device** designed for wholesalers, for quick and easy reporting of surpluses.  
- A **Telegram bot**, written in NodeJS, running in dedicated channels to receive notifications of donations, manage the transfer of goods and keep track of all sorting operations, that can be found [here](https://github.com/reflow-project/Milan-pilot/tree/main/Foody%20Zero%20Waste/telegram-bot)
