# Foody Zero Waste

![BOTTO LOGO-19 CON PAYOFF-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/642555/156575936-2aaf1838-4d0a-45a5-b4c7-254d5f1a48dd.png)

**BOTTO** has been designed and developed by OpenDot fab lab. It is a product-service that facilitates the flow of communication between wholesalers, the association RECUP that acts as intermediate for the donation of surplus fruit and vegetables, and the Italian Red Cross. OpenDot together with the partners of the Milan pilot have worked to make the city of Milan more sustainable by analysing and intervening on the food flow in both urban and peri-urban areas.

**BOTTO** is made of two main components:  
- A physical **IoT device** designed for wholesalers, for quick and easy reporting of surpluses, that can be found [here](https://github.com/reflow-project/Milan-pilot/tree/main/Foody%20Zero%20Waste/physical-device).  
- A **Telegram bot**, written in NodeJS, running in dedicated channels to receive notifications of donations, manage the transfer of goods and keep track of all sorting operations, that can be found [here](https://github.com/reflow-project/Milan-pilot/tree/main/Foody%20Zero%20Waste/telegram-bot).
